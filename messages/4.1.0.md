v4.1.0 (TODO: DATE)
-------------------

# Rewritten Styled Components highlighting

Version 4.1 offers a new Styled Components syntax that is a straightforward extension of the core CSS syntax. This replaces the old Styled Components syntax, which was borrowed from [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime). The new syntax should support all of Styled Components's extended features (such as line comments) while closely resembling the core CSS syntax.

In addition, support for `keyframes` has been improved.

# custom_templates.default

There's a new `default` sub-option for `custom_templates`. Specify a syntax for `custom_templates.default`, and all untagged templates will use that syntax.

# Improved Flow typing

- Support generic type arguments in function calls. (#118)
- Don't highlight Flow pragmas in comments anymore. (#79)
- Fix various bugs.

# Other fixes

- `string_object_keys` was applied where it shouldn't be. (https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime/issues/414)
- `jsx_close_tag` will replace the built-in `close_tag` command in any scope matching the `jsx_close_tag` setting. (#114)
- Fix various bugs with `jsx_close_tag`. (#123)

# Internal changes

- Use `logging` rather than `print` statements.
- Fix the private `build_js_custom_syntax` command used by babel-sublime, and also use it to build test syntaxes.
- Use `sublime.syntax_from_path` to wait for the test syntaxes to be built instead of explicit delays.
