v4.1.0 (TODO: DATE)
-------------------

# Rewritten Styled Components highlighting

Version 4.1 offers a new Styled Components syntax that is a straightforward extension of the core CSS syntax. This replaces the old Styled Components syntax, which was borrowed from [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime). The new syntax should support all of Styled Components's extended features (such as line comments) while closely resembling the core CSS syntax.

This change does not affect *when* the Styled Components syntax is applied.
