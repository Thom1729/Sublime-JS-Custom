JS Custom - Customizable JavaScript syntax highlighting for Sublime Text
========================================================================

Upon installation, JS Custom will compile a couple of example syntaxes, “JS Custom - Default” and “JS Custom - React”. You can try these out right away. To customize your syntaxes, choose Preferences → Package Settings → JS Custom → Settings from the menubar. When you save your user settings file, JS Custom will recompile your syntaxes on the fly.

Visit the JS Custom GitHub at https://github.com/Thom1729/Sublime-JS-Custom for full documentation, including all syntax options.

If you find a bug, need help, or have a suggestion for a new feature, please post an issue on the GitHub page.
