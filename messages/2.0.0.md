v2.0.0 (2019-01-01)
-------------------

Version 2.0 is a major rewrite of the package internals. Key user-facing changes are as follows:

- Syntaxes are built or rebuilt in a separate thread to avoid blocking the UI.
- When a syntax is rebuilt, it replaces the original atomically so that Sublime will never try to load an incomplete syntax.
- Added the `clear_js_custom_user_data` command.
- The package name is no longer hardcoded into the loading logic, hopefully improving manual installs.

Internal changes:

- Completely reorganized the code.
- Added syntax tests for core and extension functionality.
- Used `sublime_lib.ResourcePath` to manage resource paths rather than doing it manually.
